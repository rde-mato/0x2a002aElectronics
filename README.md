42 Elec Project - MIDI Sequencer

The 0x2a002a is a MIDI sequencer project. It was part of a school program at 42 Paris (http://www.42.fr/) where most students have limited to none prior experience with electronics, both Firmware and Hardware.

The project spans on a 6 month period, and was carried by Remi de Matos, Théophile Vallée and Laurent Meyer. It consists in the complete design of the project:
* definition of technical specs: user manual, capabilities, parts, consumption.
* design of the electric schemas and routing of the PCB (using Altium software)
* building, soldering, and 3D printing for some parts
* writing asynchronous firmware, without using any external libraries except for the C standard library (including SPI, I2C, UART and chip-specific drivers)

The result is a fully functional MIDI controler, capable of managing 16 instruments, with each of them 16 patterns of 16 beats.

Watch how Remi is happy about it:
